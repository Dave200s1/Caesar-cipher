## Note ![Alt text](wreath.png "Optional title")
The ceaser cipher is by today's standards obsolete and should be avoided, this is just for learning purposes

## How does it work ? ![Alt text](key.png "Optional title")
First you take an alphabet, e.g. the English alphabet, then the meaning of each letter in the alphabet is shifted to the right by X digits.
Last but not least, to decrypt the encrypted message, you need the key.

A thorough explanation about the Caeser cipher is on the following  [Wiki Page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher) available.
