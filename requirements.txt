1 Encryption Function:
    Create a function that takes a plain text and a key (the number of positions to shift each letter).
    Shift each letter of the plain text by the key value to create the encrypted text.
    Ensure that the encryption wraps around the alphabet if it reaches the end.

2 Decryption Function:
    Create a function that takes the encrypted text and the key.
    Shift each letter of the encrypted text by the reverse of the key value to retrieve the original plain text.

3 File Input/Output:
    Implement file handling to read the content of a file, apply encryption, and write the encrypted content to a new file.
    Create a separate function to read the encrypted file, apply decryption, and write the decrypted content to another file.
